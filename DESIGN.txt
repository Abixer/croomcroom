Design Decisions :

1. Django vs Ruby on Rails
	We chose django because it offers more transparency as to how things are done,
	making every decision in the web making process more explicit.
	
2. Database
	For now we are using SQLite for development, but we will change to MySQL once
	we have a dedicated server.
